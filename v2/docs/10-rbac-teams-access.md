# 10 - RBAC: teams, roles, prod vs general access

Two independent dimensions, both enforced through Grafana teams:

1. **Org role** (what you can *do*): Team Lead -> `Editor`, Developer -> `Viewer`.
2. **Access classification** (what you can *see*): `Prod-View` vs `General-View`,
   enforced via **folder permissions** - not org role.

## Login: GitHub SSO

Sign-in is **GitHub OAuth**, restricted to the `2CentsCapital` GitHub org.
Local email/password accounts still work (the `admin` user, plus anyone an
admin created by hand) but the normal path is "Sign in with GitHub".

Config lives in `grafana/grafana.ini` under `[auth.github]`; the OAuth client
id/secret come from `.env` (`GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET`) so they stay
out of git. The GitHub OAuth app's **Authorization callback URL** must be
`https://grafana-infra.valura.co.in/login/github` - that host is also set as
`server.root_url`, which is what Grafana uses to build the redirect.

What SSO does and does *not* do:

- **Does**: authenticate the person, confirm they're in the `2CentsCapital`
  org (`read:org` scope), and auto-create a Grafana user as **Viewer** on
  first login (`allow_sign_up = true`, `auto_assign_org_role = Viewer`).
- **Does not**: grant any dashboard access. A brand-new SSO user is in zero
  teams and therefore sees zero folders - exactly like a freshly created
  local user. An admin still runs the onboarding step below to put them in an
  access team (`Prod-View` / `General-View`) + a project team.

GitHub org/team -> Grafana role or team mapping (`role_attribute_path`,
`team_ids`) is deliberately not wired up - team membership stays a manual,
reviewed decision.

To revoke someone: remove them from the `2CentsCapital` GitHub org (blocks
new logins) and disable/delete the Grafana user (kills existing sessions).

## Folders

Organized by SDLC stage (dev/staging/prod), not by product - this is what
makes "developers get their own deployment dashboards without needing prod
access" possible.

| Folder | Contains | Who sees it |
|---|---|---|
| `dev` | dev-UAE, dev-IND, infra-dev, deployments-dev, deployment-builds-dev | General-View + Prod-View |
| `staging` | stg-UAE, stg-IND, infra-stg-uae, infra-stg-ind, deployments-staging, deployment-builds-staging | General-View + Prod-View |
| `prod` | prod-UAE, infra-prod-uae, deployments-prod, deployment-builds-prod | Prod-View only |
| `non-prod` | partner-apps, infra-partner-apps, infra-observability, stack-health, and the imported AWS/Cloudflare/general dashboards | General-View + Prod-View |
| `deployments` | the GLOBAL deployments/deployment-builds pair - all 181 apps across every client project on the Coolify instance, not just ours | Prod-View only |

`partner-apps` and `infra-observability` deliberately stay in `non-prod`
rather than moving into `prod` - Coolify's own environment label calls
partner-apps "production", but it's never been treated as prod-sensitive
here (moving it into the Prod-View-only `prod` folder would have quietly cut
developers off from something they could already see). `infra-observability`
is the stack's own host, not part of the UAE/IND dev->staging->prod
pipeline this split models.

Declared via the filesystem, not the UI - `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/json/<folder>/*.json`
with `foldersFromFilesStructure: true` in `dashboards.yml`. To move a dashboard
between folders, move its JSON file; Grafana re-syncs within 30s.
`scripts/gen-dashboards.py` and `scripts/gen-infra-dashboards.py` each take a
`folder` field per entry and write straight into the right subfolder, so
regenerating them keeps this layout automatically. `gen-deploy-dashboard.py`
and `gen-build-status-dashboard.py` each build one global dashboard
(`deployments` folder) plus three scoped ones (`dev`/`staging`/`prod`
folders, filtered by Coolify project name - see their `SCOPES` dict).

(Named `non-prod`, not `general` - Grafana reserves the folder name "General"
for the default/root folder and refuses to create another one with that name.)

## Teams

| Team | Kind | Members |
|---|---|---|
| `UAE` | project | leads + devs on the UAE product |
| `IND` | project | leads + devs on the IND product |
| `Partner-Apps` | project | leads + devs on partner-apps |
| `Prod-View` | access | anyone who should see `prod` and `deployments` (also sees `dev`/`staging`/`non-prod` - superset) |
| `General-View` | access | anyone who should see `dev`/`staging`/`non-prod` but not `prod` or the global `deployments` folder |

Project teams carry **no folder permissions of their own** - they're purely
organisational (who's on which squad). All dashboard visibility comes from
whichever access-classification team someone is also a member of. A person is
normally in exactly one project team + exactly one access team.

## Folder permissions (View only - nobody edits provisioned dashboards)

```
non-prod     <- General-View (View), Prod-View (View)
dev          <- General-View (View), Prod-View (View)
staging      <- General-View (View), Prod-View (View)
prod         <- Prod-View (View)
deployments  <- Prod-View (View)
```

Verified to carry *only* these team grants - no blanket Viewer/Editor
built-in-role access, so someone in zero teams sees zero dashboards regardless
of org role.

## Onboarding someone

```bash
./scripts/grafana-add-user.sh <email> "<full name>" '<temp password>' <team> <lead|dev> <prod|general>

# e.g. a UAE team lead who needs prod access:
./scripts/grafana-add-user.sh priya@company.com "Priya Sharma" 'TempPass123!' UAE lead prod

# e.g. an IND developer, general access only:
./scripts/grafana-add-user.sh raj@company.com "Raj Patel" 'TempPass123!' IND dev general
```

Creates the local account, sets the org role (Editor/Viewer), and adds them to
their project team + access team. `GRAFANA_AUTH` is required (the script
refuses to run without it - no credential is hardcoded in a file that's
committed to git):
`GRAFANA_AUTH=<admin-login>:<admin-password> GRAFANA_URL=https://grafana-infra.valura.co.in ./scripts/grafana-add-user.sh ...`
(omit `GRAFANA_URL` to default to `http://localhost:3000`, for running it
directly on `.52`). Tested end-to-end (created, verified role + both team
memberships, deleted) before this was committed. `grafana-setup-teams.py`
takes the same two env vars.

To change someone's access later: add/remove them from `Prod-View` /
`General-View` via **Administration -> Teams** in the UI, or the same
`/api/teams/:id/members` endpoint the script uses. To promote a dev to lead:
`PATCH /api/org/users/:id` with `{"role":"Editor"}`.

## Known quirk

Whoever creates a team via the API/UI is auto-added as an Admin-of-that-team
member (a Grafana behaviour, not something we set). `admin` shows up as a
member of all five teams for this reason - harmless, since `admin`'s access
comes from being a Grafana **Admin**, not from team membership.

## Verified: General-View can't see prod

Tested end-to-end with a throwaway `test` account (Viewer, `General-View`
only, no project team, deleted after): `/api/folders` correctly shows only
`non-prod`, and fetching the `production` folder directly is `403`.

This surfaced a real bug first: `prod-UAE` still showed up in `test`'s
`/api/search` results and was fetchable directly by UID (`200`, full JSON)
despite the folder being blocked. Cause: the dashboard carried its own
**direct, non-inherited** permissions (`{"role":"Viewer","permission":1}`,
`{"role":"Editor","permission":2}`) - a blanket grant to every org
Viewer/Editor that bypasses folder ACLs entirely. Dashboard-level permissions
in Grafana can override folder inheritance; only `prod-UAE` had this (audited
all 16 dashboards to confirm it wasn't systemic). Fixed by clearing it via
`POST /api/dashboards/id/:id/permissions` with `{"items": []}`.

`grafana-setup-teams.py` now sweeps every dashboard for this on each run and
strips any direct role-based grant it finds, so it can't silently recur - rerun
it after adding new dashboards if you want the same guarantee re-checked.
Re-verified after the fix: `test` saw exactly the 15 `non-prod` dashboards,
`prod-UAE` absent from search, direct fetch `403`.

## Verified: developers get dev/staging deployment dashboards, not prod

Re-tested after the dev/staging/prod folder split with the persistent `test`
account (Viewer, `General-View`, no project team): sees `dev` (5 dashboards),
`staging` (6), `non-prod` (13) - 24 total. `prod`, and the global
`deployments` folder, are both absent from search and `403` on direct UID
fetch (`prod-uae`, `deployments-prod`, `deployments`). `deployments-dev`
fetches `200`. The dashboard-permissions sweep in `grafana-setup-teams.py`
(see above) found nothing to clear on any of the new dashboards.

## Admin account

Renamed from the `admin`/`admin123` default to a named account (login/password
rotated via `PUT /api/users/:id` + `PUT /api/admin/users/:id/password`;
credentials live only in `v2/.env` - gitignored, never in this repo). To
rotate again later: same two calls, or
`docker exec grafana grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password '<new password>'`
for the password alone - then update `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` to
match (that env var only seeds a *fresh* install; it does not reset an
existing account on restart).

## Next: SSO

Deferred by request. When ready, GitHub OAuth is half-wired conceptually -
see the session notes for what's needed (an OAuth App, callback URL
`https://grafana-infra.valura.co.in/login/github`, and a decision on whether
to gate login to a specific GitHub org). SSO would replace local-account
creation but the team/folder structure above stays exactly the same.
