# One-time setup: creates the 5 RBAC teams (UAE/IND/Partner-Apps project
# teams + Prod-View/General-View access teams) and grants their folder
# permissions:
#   non-prod/dev/staging <- Viewer role (every authenticated user) + both
#                           access teams
#   prod/deployments     <- Prod-View only
# The Viewer-role grant is what lets a fresh GitHub SSO login see
# dev/staging/non-prod immediately, with no team assignment.
# Idempotent - safe to re-run, looks up existing teams instead of erroring.
# See docs/10-rbac-teams-access.md for the full RBAC model.

# every dashboard so visibility always comes from the folder, never the
